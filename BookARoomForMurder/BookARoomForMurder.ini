description.English=This scenario is inspired by the Arkham Horror LCG scenario "Murder at the Excelsior Hotel."\n\nThis scenario features a custom Mythos phase.\n\nIf any of the following investigators are chosen for this scenario, they will affect the game in terms of story text, potential Mythos events, and the end game event (if more than one of these investigators is chosen, one will be chosen randomly to affect the scenario):\n\nTommy Muldoon\nCharlie Kane\nCarolyn Fern\nFather Mateo\nJoe Diamond\n\nV1.1 - Added general improvements, fixed spelling, and added a new Mythos event that can occur for games featuring 3 or more players.\n\nV1.2 - Minor text update, added 2 positive Mythos events that can occur for games featuring 3 or more players.\n\nV1.3 - One event seemed to be too difficult based on user experiences, so it has been made easier to pass.\n\nV1.4 - Fixed an issue making the scenario harder for 2 players, and made another change making the scenario a little easier at all player counts.
